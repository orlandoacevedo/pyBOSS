# pyBOSS

pyBOSS software package for calculating chemical reactions in solution.

This software package is a Monte Carlo (MC) based simulation package that is intended for examining organic chemical reactions in solution using a mixed quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methodology. This software is a spirtual successor to the BOSS ([Biochemical and Organic Simulation System](https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.20297)) program by Prof. William L. Jorgensen at Yale University. While some backwards compatibility is maintained with BOSS here, it is highly recommended that you use [BOSS](https://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/software.html) for production work. This pyBOSS program is under development and will intergrate machine learning and other features to accelerate calculations for chemical reactivity (e.g., ML/QM/MM).
